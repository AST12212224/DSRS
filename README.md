# Discrete Square Residual Structure (DSRS)

The **Discrete Square Residual Structure (DSRS)** is an original mathematical framework that explores relationships between square residuals, discrete indexing, and special constants. This repository hosts C implementations of functions derived from DSRS, as well as examples, test cases, and documentation.

## Overview

DSRS examines how residuals of squares interact when structured under specific discrete rules. Notably, some results have deep connections to classical formulas such as the Wallis Product, as well as integer sequences (e.g., OEIS A052928, A063196). 

Through this repository, the intention is to:
- Provide clean, reproducible C code implementing the core DSRS formulas.
- Allow further exploration of how these structures generalize for different parameters (e.g., varying `mu`).
- Share examples illustrating the computational patterns that arise from DSRS.

## Features

- **C Functions:** Efficient, modular implementations of DSRS-related functions.
- **Example Programs:** Simple examples demonstrating how to use the functions.
- **Documentation:** Explanations of the formulas and their connections to known mathematical results.
